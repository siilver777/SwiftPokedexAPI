# SwiftyDexAPI

This is the API working with the [SwiftPokedex iOS application](http://www.github.com/siilver777/SwiftyDex). The API is entirely written in NodeJS and uses ExpressJS. The database is managed with SQLite.

## Requirements

You need to have node and npm installed on your machine. Update node packages and you're good to go!

## Origin of data

* The database contains information about a lot of Pokémons. Every bit of information inside is from the French website [Poképedia](http://www.pokepedia.fr/).
* Artworks and miniatures were downloaded from Poképedia as well.
* Pokémons' cries are from [PokéCries](http://pokecries.com/).
